I"–<p> Here are some of the steps I took to install Jekyll on my windows 10 device.</p>
<p> First I went to this website: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/"> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/ </a>
<p> I Installed the latest version of Jekyll and ran into some issues. The error message I got was ERROR: failed to build gem native extension. The first step I took to solving this issue was through a simple search on the internet but none of the solutions ended up working so I went to youtube to watch this video:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfP7Y9Ja6Qc"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfP7Y9Ja6Qc.
