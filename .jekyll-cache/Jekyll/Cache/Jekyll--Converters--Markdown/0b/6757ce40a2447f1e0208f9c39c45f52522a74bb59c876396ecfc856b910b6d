I"ê<p> Here are some of the steps I took to install Jekyll on my windows 10 device.</p>
<p> First I went to this website: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/"> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/ </a>
<p> I Installed the latest version of Jekyll and ran into some issues. The error message I got was  <b> ERROR: failed to build gem native extension </b>. The first step I took to solving this issue was through a simple search on the internet but none of the solutions ended up working so I went to youtube to watch this video:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfP7Y9Ja6Qc"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfP7Y9Ja6Qc </a>  </p>

<p> The youtuber, Mike Dane, has many helpful vides but nothing helped fixed issue. The reason I ran into the error that I mentioned above was because the latest version of jekyll had some issues. As a result of that problem I reinstalled ruby using ruby 2.6.9 with the devkit and folllowed the rest of the instructions listed on the installation website. The issue I had was resolved after I used the older version.</p>

<p> I hope this guide helped you install jekyll on your machine.</p>
