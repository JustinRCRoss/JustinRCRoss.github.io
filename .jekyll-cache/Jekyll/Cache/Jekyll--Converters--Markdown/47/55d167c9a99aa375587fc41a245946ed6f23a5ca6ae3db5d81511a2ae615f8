I"<p> Here are some of the steps I took to install Jekyll on my windows 10 device.</p>
<p> First I went to this website: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/"> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/ </a>
<p> I Installed the latest version of Jekyll and ran into some issues. The error message I got was ERROR: failed to build gem native extension</p>
